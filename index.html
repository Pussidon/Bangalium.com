    <h3>In here we will take part in experimentations. We will mainly focus in the feild of Physics.
        The first experiment is going to be about Oscillation. So, one may ask, what is Oscillation?
        well In Physics, oscillation means a repetitive motion that happens in a variation with 
        respect to time. There is usually a central value, where the object would be at rest. 
        Additionally, there are two or more positions between which the repetitive motion takes place.
        The prime example of oscillation is The tides in the sea and the movement of a simple pendulum 
        of the clock are some of the most common examples of oscillations. The vibrations caused by the 
        guitar strings and the other instruments having strings are also examples of oscillations.

    <h3>Even the beating of our heart creates oscillations. Now, we will dive into pendulum.
        What is a pendulum? The mechanism of a weight hung from a fixed point so that it can 
        swing freely, especially a rod with a weight at the end that regulates the mechanism 
        of a clock is called a pendulum.If a heavy point mass is suspended by a weightless, 
        inextensible, and perfectly flexible string from rigid support then this arrangement 
        is called a simple pendulum.Expression for time period:
    </h3>
    <h3>For an angular momentum,  sin θ, so that</h3>
        
    <h3>F = -mgsin θ</h3>
        
    <h3>  = -mgθ</h3>
        
    <h3>  = -( mg/l )y = -Ky</h3>
        
        
    <h3>Because Y = lθ, thus the time period of the simple pendulum is: T=2π√L/g. 
        This equation is valid only when the length of a simple pendulum (l) is negligible 
        as compared to the radius of the earth.
    </h3>
        
    <h3>a simple pendulum of density rho is made to oscillate in a liquid of density rho 
        then its time period will increase as compared to that of air and is given by:
    </h3>
    <h3>T=2πL−−√1−(σρ)
    </h3>

    <h3>If the bob of a simple pendulum has positive charge q and the pendulum is placed in a 
        uniform electric field E which is in a vertically downward direction then the time period decreases.
    </h3>
    <h3>T=2πL−−√g+qem</h3>
        
        
    <h3>Compound Pendulum:</h3>
        
    <h3>Any rigid body which is free to oscillate in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis 
        passing through a point is defined as a compound pendulum
    </h3>
